To create a background service in Android Studio using Java, first create a new class extending Service and override the onStartCommand() and onBind() methods. Add the service to your AndroidManifest.xml. Start the service in your activity with startService(new Intent(this, MyBackgroundService.class)). Handle any long-running tasks within the service and stop it with stopSelf() when tasks are complete.
